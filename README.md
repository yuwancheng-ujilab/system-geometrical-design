Codes used in 'Geometrical design of a crystal growth system guided by a machine learning algorithm'

These codes are used for machine learning and genetic algrithom for geometrical design of a crystal growth system using data generated by software CGSIM.
However, it can be applicable broadly for both experimental and theoretical researchers in various areas.
These codes just indicate a possible method.
